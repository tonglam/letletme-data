# letletme-data
This project will use the following programming paradigms, technologies and libraries:
- Functional Programming: This project focuses on fetching, transforming, and storing data, and functional programming is well-suited for the task.
- Node.js: This project requires extensive I/O usage and asynchronous processing, which aligns with the design principles of Node.js.
- TypeScript: A powerful tool for enforcing type constraints in backend development.
- Redis: Can't find a better option for caching and speeding up the program, right?
- MongoDB/MySQL: to compare with the previous version and the backend architecture of letletme, decided to implement double writing to both databases. I will consider dropping MySQL when my cloud MySQL subscription expires.
- Ramda
